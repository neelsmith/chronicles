                <head>On Moments and Hours</head>
                <p> Times are divided into moments, hours, days, months, years, ages, and epochs.</p>
                <p>Named after the motion of the stars, a moment is the smallest and briefest period
                    of time, for it is the limit of an hour in short intervals when something has
                    moved and then succeeded itself.</p>
                <p> [H]ora is a Greek term that nonetheless sounds Latin, for [h]ora is a limit of
                    time in the same way as [h]ora are also limits of the sea, rivers, and clothes.</p>
                <p> It is composed of four puncta, ten minutes, and forty moments. </p>
                <p>And we must note, in order to avoid error, that the computus depends partly on
                    nature and partly on authority or custom: nature, as we hold that the common
                    year lasts for twelve lunar months; custom, that months may be reckoned in
                    thirty days; and authority, that a week consists of seven days. </p>
            </div0>

            <div0 n="2">
                <head>On the Day</head>
                <p>In common usage, day is the presence of the sun above the earth; properly
                    speaking, it is [the interval of time] completed in twenty-four hours.</p>
                <p>The Chaldaeans and the Persians reckon it between two risings of the sun, the
                    Egyptians between two settings of the sun, the Romans from midnight to midnight,
                    and the Umbrians and the Athenians from midday to midday.</p>
                <p>Moses, however, calls a day [the interval of time] from one morning to the next;
                    but at the resurrection of the Lord, the evening of the Sabbath dawned on the
                    first day of the Sabbath so that humankind, after falling from the light into
                    the shadows, might then return from the shadows to the light. </p>
            </div0>
            <div0 n="3">
                <head>On the Night</head>
                <p> Night is the absence of the sun when it has been hidden by the shadow of the
                    earth, and has been designed as a time for mortals to rest so that humanity
                    should not perish from long, insatiable toil [when it is harder, then it is also
                    more favorable for reducing work and the limbs]. </p>
                <p> There are seven parts of the night: crepusculum, that is, the doubtful light
                    between light and shadows (for we call creperum doubtful); vesperum, when star
                    of the same name appears; conticinium, when everything is quiet; intempestum is
                    the middle of the night and period of inactivity; gallicinium when the cock
                    crows; matutinum is between the departure of the shadows of the night and the
                    coming of dawn; and diluculum just when the small light of day is beginning.
                    This light and the dawn extend as far as sunrise. </p>
            </div0>

            <div0 n="4">
                <head>On the Week</head>
                <p> The week consists of seven days; the eighth, however, is the same as the first
                    day to which it returns, and so the week is constantly begun again.</p>
                <p> The gentiles named them after the planets, believing that they had a spirit from
                    the sun, a body from the moon, blood from Mars, intelligence and language from
                    Mercury, temperance from Jupiter, lust from Venus, and slowness from Saturn.</p>

                <p>But St. Sylvester established that the days be called feriae, naming the first
                    day the Lord's Day and thereby emulating the Hebrews who name them the first day
                    of the Sabbath, the second day of the Sabbath, and the rest according to their
                    number.</p>
                <p>Among the Hebrews, a hebdomada is also completed in the same number of years,
                    which complete a hebdomada in he tdays of the hebdomadae.</p>
                <p>Similarly, they also had a fiftieth Pentecost day in years, but calling it a
                    jubilee year (which means liberty). </p>

            <div0 n="5">
                <head>On the Month</head>
                <p>The lunar month is effected by the waxing and the waning of the moon, while it
                    goes through the zodiac in a little more than 28 and one-half days, but ease of
                    computation alternates the lunar months with thirty and twenty-nine days.</p>
                <p> However the solar month is greater by 22 hours, and the eleven days of the
                    Epacts accumulate from these. The sun exceeds the course of the moon in a single
                    year by these eleven days, for twelve times twenty-two makes 264, and eleven
                    times twenty-four completes the same number. </p>
                <p> But the Hebrews begin their months from the new moon, and the Romans from the
                    Kalends. </p>
                <p>The Egyptians begin their months from the fourth day of the Kalends of September
                    all the way through the ninth day of the same Kalends, calculating their months
                    in 30 days; they call the five remaining days intercalaries.</p>
                <p>They were the first to begin to define the months according to the path of the
                    sun so that the swifter and less certain passage of the moon would not create an
                    obstacle to calculating for their calculation. </p>
            </div0>

            <div0 n="6">
                <head>On the Months of the Romans</head>
                <p>As established by Romulus, the Romans went through a year in ten months, but in
                    three hundred and four days.</p>
                <p>He named the first month after his father Mars; he named the second April after
                    ripening of fruit; the third after Maia, the mother of Mercury, the fourth he
                    dedicated to Juno.</p>
                <p>Quintilis and Sextilis, which are now named after the birth of Julius Caesar and
                    the triumph of Augustus, and the following months, he chose names based on their
                    number.</p>
                <p> The beginning of the months he called the Kalends because at that time, it was
                    announced how many days were remaining until the Nones when the plebs had been
                    summoned [<foreign lang="lat">calata</foreign>] (that is, "called") into the
                    Capitol by repeating the word "<foreign lang="lat">calo</foreign>" (that is, "to
                    call") five or seven times. </p>
                <p> Moreover, he called the middle of the month the Nones because on the ninth day
                        [<foreign lang="lat">nono die</foreign>] before the Ides they assembled in
                    the city in order to know what must be done in that month.</p>
                <p>Further, he called the Ides the day that divides the middle of the month, because
                        <foreign lang="etrucscan">iduare</foreign> means to divide in the Etruscan
                    language.</p>
                <p>Numa, adding two months to these, January from Janus and February from Februus,
                    who should be celebrated as the god of lustrations, arranged the year with three
                    hundred and fifty-four days according to the course of the moon.</p>
                <p>Julius Caesar established the year as it is used today, with the addition of
                    eleven days. </p>
            </div0>
            <div0 n="7">
                <head>On the Solstice and the Equinox</head>
                <p> The solstices and both the equinoxes are thought to be on the eighth day before
                    the Kalends of January, July, April, and October, that is in the eighth degrees
                    of Capricorn, Cancer, Aries, and Liber.</p>
                <p> But the equinoctial day is equal [in length] for the entire world.</p>
                <p>Howver because of the different increase in the light, the longest day in Meroe
                    totals 12 equinoctial hours and eight parts of one hour, in Alexandria, 14
                    hours, in Italy 15, and in Britain 17, where in the summer bright nights are
                    indisputably attested.</p>
                <p>Reason compels us to believe that on the days of the solstice when the sun
                    approaches nearer the pole of the world because of the narrow angle of the light
                    the parts of the Earth lying below it have continuous days for six months, and
                    [continuous] nights [for six months] when the sun has been withdrawn to the
                    winter solstice.</p>
                <p>Pytheas of Massilia writes that this happens on the island of Thyle which is a
                    six day sail north of Britain. </p>
            </div0>
            <div0 n="8">
                <head>On the Seasons</head>
                <p>The seasons are cycles of change by which the sun tempers the earth as it
                    progresses from perigee to apogee.</p>
                <p> For winter is cold and damp while the sun delays for a long time; Spring is damp
                    and warm when it returns; summer is warm and dry when it heats up; Autumn is dry
                    and cold as it diminishes.</p>
                <p>The ancients began the seasons on the sixth day before the Ides of February, May,
                    August, and November, so that the solstices and the equinoxes were in the middle
                    of seasons.</p>
                <p>However, spring is connected to the orient because at that time all things arise
                    from the earth; summer to the south because part of it is more burning with
                    heat; Autumn to the west because it has grave illnesses due to the closeness of
                    heat and cold; Winter to the North because it is sluggish from the cold. </p>
            </div0>

            <div0 n="9">
                <head>On Years</head>
                <p> The Solar (or civic) year is the period when the sun runs through the zodiac in
                    365 and one quarter days; the Romans begin the year from the winter, the Hebrews
                    from the spring equinox, the Greeks from the solstice, the Egyptians from
                    autumn.</p>
                <p>The common lunar year is composed of twelve lunar months, that is, 354 days. The
                    embolismic year is composed of thirteen months and three hundred and eighty four
                    days, beginning in the lunation of Easter.</p>
                <p>The Great Year is when all the stars return to their proper position when the
                    established paths have been completed, which Josephus claims is completed in six
                    hundred solar years. </p>

            </div0>
            <div0 n="10">
                <head>On the Leap-Year Day</head>
                <p> The leap-year day is composed at a four year interval from the proportion of a
                    quarter of a day, while the sun returns to the sign of the zodiac from which it
                    departed not in 365 days but in [365 days] and a quarter of day.</p>
                <p>For example, if the rising sun now enters the equinoctial position of the sky, it
                    will enter this point in the following year at noon, in the third year during
                    the evening, in the fourth year at midnight, and in the fifth year again at
                    sunrise.</p>
                <p>This necessarily forewarns that a day must be added so that the spring equinox
                    will not occur on the winter solstice after 365 years if by chance the leap-year
                    day is not added.</p>
                <p> The Egyptians insert this leap-year day after the year has been completed (that
                    is on the fourth day before the Kalends of September), the Romans on the sixth
                    day before the Kalends of March, whence the intercalation receives its name "the
                    second sixth" (bissextus). </p>
                <p> Now in the common and also shorter explanation, the slowing of the sun, which
                    does not return fully to the same line [on the sundial] in 365 days, brings
                    forth a leap-year day; and if, for instance, on the spring equinox, which
                    according to the Egyptians falls on the 12th day before the Kalends of April,
                    you observe the sun rising from the mid-point of the east [ie, the celestial
                    equator], you will find in the following year that it rises further down [i.e.,
                    further south] on the same day, and in the third year, and fourth year, and
                    fifth year you will find that the same slowing down accumulates so that — unless
                    you add a day beforehand — the sun will rise from the mid-point of the east to
                    bring about the equinox on the eleventh day before the Kalends of April, and
                    will continue the same pattern of slowing down in the other risings and settings
                    as well throughout the year. </p>

            <div0 n="11">
                <head>On the Nineteen Year Cycle</head>
                <p>The Council of Nicea instituted the nineteen year cycle because of [the problem
                    of] the fourteenth day of the Paschal month, because each lunar month, having
                    past in 235 cycles through a period of nineteen years, returns on an unerring
                    course to the same day of the solar year.</p>
                <p>The nineteen year cycle is divided into <foreign lang="grc-xlit">ogdoas</foreign>
                    and <foreign lang="grc-xlit">hendecas</foreign> (that is into 8- and 11-year
                    periods); for eight lunar years exceed the same number of solar years by only
                    two days, one of which falls in the calendar for the completion of the <foreign
                        lang="grc-xlit">hendecas</foreign>, while the other is used up by the
                    computation of the saltus, since the solar <foreign lang="grc-xlit"
                    >hendecas</foreign> would exceed the lunar by one day.</p>
                <p>Admittedly, some people try violently to fill out these days with the leap-year
                    days of the eight years; although the leap-year day in the month of February,
                    after it has extended to the sun and the month normally predetermines nothing
                    for future time, and they themselves add no leap-year day to the <foreign
                        lang="grc-xlit">hendecas</foreign>.</p>
                <p>Therefore,to speak more plainly, the two days of the month which are in excess in
                    the <foreign lang="grc-xlit">ogdoas</foreign> will fill out the two that are
                    lacking in the <foreign lang="grc-xlit">hendecas</foreign>. </p>
            </div0>

            <div0 n="12">
                <head>On the Saltus of the Moon</head>
                <p>The position and swifter time of the new moon causes the saltus of the moon over
                    the course of nineteen years; for although some people, who calculate individual
                    months with twenty-nine and one half days constantly alternate the new moons of
                    the months by half a day and by half a night, they do not in this search for the
                    truth of nature, but for ease of calculation.</p>
                <p> For if you seek nature, the new moon of the first month which now appears at
                    noon, and the moon of the second month, which appears at midnight, in a future
                    year shine at one hour and ten moments and half a moment and one nineteenth of
                    half a moment before the middle of the day or night.</p>
                <p>However, this distinction does not lead to a clear limit of either the embolismic
                    or common year, but the equal division of nineteen years.</p>
                <p>And so over the course of nineteen years the new moon causes itself to be
                    calculated in 383 days by anticipating the period of one day and by losing the
                    final year of the nineteen year cycle.</p>
                <p> But if you neglect to do this over the course of fifteen nineteen-year cycles,
                    your fifteenth moon will fall [on the same date as] when it is first reckoned.

                <head>The Contents of the Same Cycle</head>
                <p> The Cycle of Easter has been constructed in 8 columns. The first column contains
                    the years from the incarnation of the Lord, increasing at intervals of single
                    years.</p>
                <p>The second column contains the indictions of the Romans, which always reset in
                    the course of 15 years.</p>
                <p>The third contains the eleven lunar epact days, which increase in each solar year
                    according to the course of the moon; placed in the calendar on the eleventh day
                    before the Kalends of April, they are added cumulatively to find the age of the
                    moon on the Kalends.</p>
                <p> The fourth column contains the concurrent days of the week, which are placed in
                    the calendar on the eighth day before the Kalends of April in accordance withh
                    the loss of the leap-year day, and are necessarily completed in twenty-eight
                    years; the computation of these compels that twenty-eight nineteen-year cycles
                    be recorded so that individual concurrent days begin individual cycles and so
                    that the whole calculation of Easter be completed in 532 years.</p>


                <p>The fifth column contains the lunar cycle, which the nineteen-year cycle precedes
                    by three years, and which is itself also contained in 19 years.</p>
                <p>The sixth column contains the dates of the full moon — the time when our elders
                    observed Pascha. As they wander in their changing current from the twelfth day
                    before the Kalends of April to the 14th day before the Kalends of May, they
                    admit a time of the new moon from the 8th day before the Ides of March up to the
                    Nones of April. </p>
                <p>However, there are 354 days from the full moon up to the full moon of the
                    following year if it is the common year, 384 days if it is the embolismic year.</p>
                <p>In the seventh column, freely extended on account of the computation of the
                    embolismic years, the Sundays of Easter are found from the 11th day before the
                    Kalends of April up to the 7th day before the Kalends of May.</p>
                <p>In the final column is the age of the moon of the Paschal Feast varying on
                    account of Sunday from 15 to 22. </p>

                <head>Formulas for the categories of the Easter table</head>
                <p> If you want to know how many years there are from the incarnation of the Lord,
                    learn how many the numbers of indictions are, for instance, for the fifth year
                    of the reign of Tiberius, 46; multiply these by 15, they become 690; always add
                    12 regulars (because the Lord was born on the fourth indiction according to
                    Dionysius) and the indiction of the year you want, for instance, in the present
                    case, one; they total 703.</p>
                <p>Those are the years of the birth of the Lord.</p>
                <p> If you want to know the number of the indiction, take the years of the Lord and
                    add three; divide by 15, and what will remains i itself the indiction of the
                    current year.</p>
                <p>If you want to know the number of the lunar epacts, divide the years of the Lord
                    by 19, and multiply what remains by 11; likewise divide by 30, and the epacts
                    remain.</p>
                <p>If you want to know the concurrent days of the week, take the years of the Lord
                    and add one quarter of their number; to these, add four more because there were
                    five concurrent days in the year of the Lord's birth; divide these by seven and
                    the solar epacts remain.</p>
                <p>If you want to know the year number of the nineteen-year cycle, take the years of
                    the Lord and add one because he was born in the second year of the cycle; divide
                    by 19 and what will remain is itself the year of the nineteen year cycle.</p>
                <p>If you want to know the number of the lunar cycle, take the years of the Lord
                    and, subtracting two, divide by 19; and what will remain is itself the year of
                    the lunar cycle.</p>
                <p>If you want to know the leap-year, divide the years of the Lord by 4; the
                    remainder gives the years from the leap year.</p>
                <p>Once you have found the foregoing values, you will easily discover the day and
                    lunar phase of Easter.</p>
                <p>If you wish to know the epacts and to find the concurrent solar days for some
                    number of years from the present, for example, after 100 Easters, it is
                    sufficient to divide one hundred by 19, and 5 remains; you will know therefore
                    that the [same lunar] epacts will fall in the hundredth year which fall in the
                    fifth year.</p>
                <p>In the same way dividing one hundred by 28 you will find that the concurrent
                    solar days in the hundredth year are [the same as] those in the sixteenth year.

                <head>On the Sacrament of the Time of Easter</head>
                <p> Easter does not recur on the same day of the year as the time period of the
                    Lord's birth does, because in the latter case the commemoration of the birth
                    itself is considered so solemn.</p>
                <p>But in the former case, the mysteries of future life are celebrated and its
                    benefits are received, whence comes the very name of Pascha which signifies the
                    transition from death to life.</p>
                <p>The Pascha demands a time appropriate for the mysteries: first, [it demands] that
                    the shadows of death be conquered by the true light when the equinox has passed;
                    then, [it demands] that in the first month of the year which is called the month
                    of new things the joys of new life are celebrated; third, [it demands] that the
                    resurrection should come in the third week of the moon's cycle, since the
                    resurrection happened on the third day and in the time of the third age (that is
                    the age manifested through grace, since it already lay hidden before the law and
                    under the law in the prophetic riddle); when the cycle of the moon itself
                    teaches us that the glory of the mind is changed from earthly matters to
                    heavenly contemplation; and finally [it demands] that we should remember the
                    Lord's day as it is noteworthy for its occurrence of light, should be honored
                    for the triumph of Christ, and is to be desired for our own resurrection. </p>

                <head>Concerning the Ages of the World</head>
                <p>The time periods of the world are divided into six ages.</p> 
                <p>The first age is from
                    Adam to Noah, containing ten generations and 1,656 years; all of which perished
                    in the Flood, just as infancy is normally immersed in oblivion.</p> 
                <p>The
                    second age is from Noah to Abraham, similarly comprising ten generations but
                    only 292 years; this age is discovered in language, namely Hebrew, for 
                    humankind begins to know how to speak
                    from childhood onward [only] after infancy, from which this receives its name
                    because it is not able to speak [<foreign lang="lat">fari</foreign>].
                 </p> 
                <p>The third age is from Abraham
                    to David, containing 14 generations and 942 years; and because
                    from adolescence
                    humankind
                    begins to be able to procreate, Matthew took up the beginning of
                    generations from Abraham, who also is established as the father of the peoples.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The fourth age is from David to the Babylonian Captivity, extended for 14
                    generations (likewise according to Matthew) and 473 years, 
                    from which the time period of kings began, for youthful dignity is suitable for
                    ruling.</p> 
                <p>The fifth age, then, reaches to the coming of the Savior in
                    the flesh in fourteen generations,  and 589 years, in which the
                    Hebrew people, as though exhausted with the weight of old age, 
                    is afflicted with frequent calamities.</p> 
                <p>The sixth age, which is now ongoing, has no certain sequence of
                    generations or time periods but, as the age itself is decrepit, must end with
                    the death of the entire age. </p>
